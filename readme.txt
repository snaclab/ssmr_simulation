1. please go to NS3 website to download related file and then establish NS3-simulation environment.
2. $./waf --run lte-ca run the data rate simulation code lte-ca.cc.
3. the data rate simulation results show in the file pos_eXX.txt and pos_sXX.txt.
	the first line in pos_sXX.txt means data rate between source and relays
	the second line in pos_eXX.txt means data rate between relays and base station.
4. the algorithm simulation is in Simulation folder, use the java code and data rate simulation results to simulate our method.
